This is the team project of CSCE 638.

create_emb.ipynb create an embeddings of senteces in the context and questions. create_emb-wiki-pipeline.ipynb create the embeddings for question in Squad dataset and contexts from wikipedia. create_emb-wiki-custom-input.ipynb create embeddings for custom questions and corresponding wikipedia page and also perform the unsupervised learning task as descrbed below.

unsupervised.ipynb basically calcuate the disntance between the embeddings of questions and contexts and find the most similar sentence based metrics like cosine similarity and so on. unsupervised-wiki.ipynb do the same task except the context is form wikipedia.
